# Terrance's Playground

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

## Who am I?

I'm Terrance — a tuition teacher by day, and a self-teaching programmer by night.

I started this website because I wanted a space to document my learning, my thoughts, and the things I build along the way.
It's messy, it's imperfect, and that's exactly how I like it.

## What's this site about?

[terrancehah.com](https://terrancehah.com) is a collection of my thoughts, articles, and projects.

This is where I:

- **Write articles** about things that matter to me — education, technology, writing, and nature
- **Build projects** that help me learn new skills and solve problems
- **Play around** with ideas that spark my curiosity

## The Journey

I studied International Business, then found myself in education.
Working with students made me realize how broken some parts of our education system are.
I decided to learn programming, and I hope to help kids embrace technology as a tool for learning, not just entertainment.

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Next.js for some projects
- Python and FastAPI for backend experiments
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Hosted on Vercel

## A Note

This website is a constant work in progress.
Some things might be broken, some experiments might fail, and some ideas might not make sense.
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

If you're reading this, thank you for being part of the journey.
