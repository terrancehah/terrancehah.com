      <p>Hi, This is Terrance. I majored in International Business in the colllege. After I graduated from the college, I co-founded a <a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/TalentKingTuitionCentre" title="Talent King Tuition Centre" target="_blank">tuition centre</a> in Johor Bahru with two of my partners. Currently I am self teaching to code. I intend to use this website to record my daily learning, and also some of my investment milestones. Stay tuned for more updates! Cheers!</p>
