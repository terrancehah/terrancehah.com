      <h3>I used to major in International Business. After I graduated, I started to engage in the educational field.</h3>

      <h3>Kids are only trained to be good employees. Nobody asked if they enjoy learning in school. Scores matter the most than before. Talents besides academic performances are not appreciated.</h3>

      <h3>And there is a trend of technology addiction on kids. I started to think, instead of stopping kids from using phones and computers, why not embrace the power of technology?</h3>

      <h3>So here I am, self-teaching to be a programmer as a teacher. I strive to empower the children with the power of technology.</h3>
