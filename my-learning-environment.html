      <h1>My learning environment</h1>
      <h3 id="time">written on 11 April 2021</h3>
      <p>Today, I'm going to share a little about my learning environment. This article should serve as a guide for future new learners, as I am going through the programming learning curve as a beginner.
          <br><br>Firstly, I am using an Acer laptop model E5-474G. It is a six-year-old laptop, which I had upgraded its hard drive to a SSD drive two years ago (one of my best decisions ever).
          <br><br>I subscribed to a learning platform named '<a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com" title="Codecademy" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>', and the course I am currently in is 'Full-Stack Engineer'. I have been paying the fee monthly. Paying annually seems to be a better choice though, since it comes with a discount.

            <span class='caption'>The course I am in currently</span>
          </span> 
          <br>Most of the time, the course allows me to write online, directly on the interface that Codecademy provides. However, sometimes I do write on my editor when I encounter some projects that are much complex or sophisticated.
          <br><br>As for the editor, I am using Visual Studio Code under version 1.55.1 by the time I am writing this. I had also made some customisations on my editors, such as the theme, shortcut keys and feature integrations.

          </span> 
          <br> 
          That is all for my learning environment. I will keep this article updated if I have get my learning environment updated. Till next time!
